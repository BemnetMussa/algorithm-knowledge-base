# Algorithm Knowledge Base

Welcome to our collaborative DSA learning space.

This repository is a student-powered knowledge base for the A2SV Software Engineer Trainee Training Program, and it is open to all algorithm lovers who want to learn and share. Each contributor adds at least one clear, beginner-friendly algorithm note, and everyone benefits from shared explanations, examples, and practice questions. Progress can be fast or slow, and that is okay; this repo is about learning together, building confidence, and helping one another.

> "Shared knowledge is far greater than individual knowledge."

## Quality Guidelines

Write for a fellow student who is struggling, not for an expert.

- Be kind, clear, and practical.
- Use plain language before advanced terms.
- Add small diagrams when useful (ASCII diagrams or image links are welcome).
- Prefer short sections and concrete examples over long theory.
- Include practice problems from platforms like LeetCode or Codeforces when relevant.
- Perfection is not required; clarity and effort matter most.

## Example Note (Reference): Binary Search

````markdown
# Binary Search

## One-sentence definition
Binary Search finds a target value in a sorted list by repeatedly checking the middle element and cutting the search space in half.

## When to use it (use cases)
- When data is sorted and you need fast lookups.
- When linear search is too slow for large arrays.

## Step-by-step explanation (plain language, no code first)
1. Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the sorted list.
2. Find the middle index.
3. Compare the middle value with the target:
   - If equal, you found it.
   - If target is smaller, continue in the left half.
   - If target is larger, continue in the right half.
4. Repeat until found or until `left` passes `right` (not found).

## Templates (Python)

### Iterative binary search
Use when: searching for an exact match in a sorted array.
Input: `nums` — sorted list of integers; `target` — value to find.
Output: index of `target`, or `-1` if not found.
```python
def binary_search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1
```

## Time & space complexity (Big O)
- Time: `O(log n)`
- Space: `O(1)` (iterative version)

## Practice questions (concept check)
1. Why does Binary Search require a sorted array?
2. What happens when the target does not exist in the array?
3. How is Binary Search faster than linear search for large inputs?

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

1. Because the decision to go left or right only works when elements are ordered.
2. The loop ends when `left > right`, and we return `-1` (or "not found").
3. Binary Search removes half the remaining data each step (`O(log n)`), while linear search checks one by one (`O(n)`).

## Practice questions (LeetCode/Codeforces)
1. [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search)
2. [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position)
3. [Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array)

## One thing that was confusing to me
At first, I was confused about why the loop condition is `left <= right` and not `left < right`; I learned that `<=` is needed so single-element ranges are still checked.

## FAQ

### Can I submit more than one algorithm?
Yes. Please submit one first, wait until it is merged, then you can claim and submit another.

### What if I do not know Git/GitHub well?
That is completely fine. You can use this beginner guide: [GitHub Pull Request Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).  
If needed, you may also share your `.md` file with a maintainer, and we can help upload it.

### How will I be credited?
You will be credited by your GitHub username in commit/PR history, and you may include your real name in your note if you want.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, write in your own words (no plagiarism), and help your classmates learn.
